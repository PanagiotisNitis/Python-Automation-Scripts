# 🛡️ Python Security Automation & Tool Kit

### **Project Goal**
This portfolio consists of **8 Cybersecurity Tools** written in **Python**. My main goal was to translate theory into practice by creating scripts that solve real-world problems faced by roles such as **SOC Analyst (Tier 1)** and **Junior Penetration Tester**.

* **Philosophy:** I focused on building tools that cover the entire security lifecycle: **Reconnaissance**, **Triage**, **Incident Response**, and **Forensics**.

## 🛠️ The 8 Tools and Their Practical Application

| Project | Category | What It Does (Practical Application) | Key Skills |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. FIM Tool** | **Defensive/Integrity** | Monitors critical files (e.g., system configs) for **unauthorized changes** (Alerting). | **SHA-256 Hashing**, File Integrity Monitoring. |
| **2. Log Parser** | **Log Analysis/SOC** | Converts raw logs into **structured JSON** for easy ingestion into a **SIEM** (Splunk/ELK). | **Regular Expressions (Regex)**, Data Normalization. |
| **3. Packet Sniffer** | **Forensics** | Captures network packets to identify **unencrypted credentials** or payloads in HTTP traffic. | **Scapy**, Network Protocol Analysis (Raw Data). |
| **4. Port Scanner** | **Network Recon** | Quickly detects **open ports** and services on a target to map the attack surface. | **Python Sockets**, TCP Handshake. |
| **5. Web Fuzzer** | **Web Testing** | Discovers **hidden files** and directories on Web Servers to expand the scope of testing. | **HTTP Requests**, Threading, Status Codes. |
| **6. Threat Intel** | **Threat Intelligence** | Checks suspicious IPs via **API** for immediate alert validation and risk scoring. | **API Calls**, Risk Scoring. |
| **7. FTP Brute Force** | **Offensive** | Tests the resilience of passwords on FTP services (Identifying weak credentials). | **Networking Protocols**, Error Handling. |
| **8. Ping Sweep** | **Network Recon** | Quickly identifies **live hosts** across a large network range. | **ICMP Protocol**, Threading. |

## 💡 Key Takeaways (For Recruiters)

* **Skills:** I have hands-on experience using **Python** for **Network Analysis**, **Data Processing (Logs)**, and **Automated Testing**.
* **Context:** I understand how these tools fit into the incident lifecycle (e.g., **FIM alert** $\rightarrow$ **Log Analysis** $\rightarrow$ **Packet Sniffer Forensics**).
* **Technologies:** I utilized specialized libraries such as **Scapy, hashlib, requests, and threading**, going beyond basic Python scripting.
